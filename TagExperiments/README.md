This is a sort of extended sketch to try and monitor unexpected changes to my music library.
The idea is that i have a window that can read and watch my music library by syncing it with a postgres database,
and then i can run queries on it to check for specific issues that can arise.

There's not a whole lot yet,
but i'm posting it here so that i can post about code i'm happy with.
